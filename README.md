# Selfdriving-car_RL-
This project aims to develop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent capable of controlling a simulated vehicle, effectively creating a self-driving car. The core objective is to train an agent to make optimal driving decisions—such as accelerating, braking, and steering—to navigate in CarRacing-v3 (gymnasium enviromen).
